create a node CLI script in /gitfarm called review.js that loops through every folder in the current directory and if that folder is a repo then log the most recent commit and if it is not a repo offer to execute git init && git add . && git commit -m 'Getting started' inside that folder, craft a brief README.md file that describes the project, keep the code as minimal as possible

create a vanilla HTML project in /gitfarm with index.html, scripts.js, and styles.css that serves as a front end, update the README.md with a description of this front end, keep the code as minimal as possible
